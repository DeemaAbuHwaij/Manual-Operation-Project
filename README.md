# Manual-Operation-Project
● Collected and processed videos of manual operations such as screwing, pushing,
and measuring using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), PyTorch, and
MediaPipe.
● Trained a model to detect and classify these operations, improving automated
performance measurement.
● Addressed challenges in automated detection and classification of manual
operations in video sequences
